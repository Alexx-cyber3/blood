 You will need two terminals open (one for the backend and one for the frontend).

  1. Start the Backend (Flask)
  Open a terminal in the blood folder and run:
   1 cd backend
   2 python app.py
  The API will run at `http://localhost:5000`.


  2. Start the Frontend (React)
  Open a new terminal in the blood folder and run:
   1 cd frontend
   2 npm run dev
  The website will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal).
